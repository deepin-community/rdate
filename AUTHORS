The following messages were written by David Snyder inside this AUTHORS file:

20050211 - It has been my supreme pleasure to turn this piece of OpenBSD
software into a package for use by non-OpenBSD users. All copyrights and
licenses are that of the original coder (I abhor borrowed plumage) and
have applied my copyright to only the code I've added. But that being
said, all errors and omissions are mine and mine alone. If you find any,
feel free to email at the address below.

20060918 - Well, after a long absence, I've gone and updated the code the
latest OBSD version of rdate.
